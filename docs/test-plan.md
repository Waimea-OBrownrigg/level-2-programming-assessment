# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## Can the cars go back to the start

Once a car completes a lap, it should be sent back to the start of the track.

### Test Data To Use

To test this I'll run the code multiple times with the cars going at different speeds.

### Expected Test Result

once a car gets sent back, it should keep moving the remaining amount of spaces in relation to how fast it is going, 
e.g. a car going 80Kmph moves 2 spaces at the end, and then 6 at the start.
